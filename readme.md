# Getting MEAN application code

This is the code for the sample 'Loc8r' application that is built through the course of my book [Getting MEAN](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node).

Getting MEAN is published by Manning, and teaches readers how to develop web applications end-to-end using the MEAN stack.

## The application at various stages

There are named branches for the various states of the code throughout the book:

* `master` **Chapter 3 start**: A blank Express 4.9.0 project
* `chapter-03` **Chapter 3 end**: Creating and setting up a MEAN project
* `chapter-04-views` **Chapter 4 mid-point**: The data is hard coded into views
* `chapter-04` **Chapter 4 end**: Building a static site with Node.js and Express
* `chapter-05` **Chapter 5**: Building a data model with MongoDB and Mongoose
* `chapter-06` **Chapter 6**: Writing a REST API: Exposing your MongoDB database to the application
* `chapter-07` **Chapter 7**: Consuming a REST API: Using an API from inside Express
* `chapter-08` **Chapter 8**: Adding Angular components to an Express application
* `chapter-09` **Chapter 9**: Building a Single Page Application with Angular: Foundations
* `chapter-10` **Chapter 10**: Building a Single Page Application with Angular: The next level
* `chapter-11` **Chapter 11**: Authenticating users, managing sessions and securing APIs

## Get the code

To get the code for a specific branch:

`$ git clone -b branch-name https://github.com/simonholmes/getting-MEAN.git`

Then change into the folder the git clone command will create:

`$ cd getting-MEAN`

And finally install the dependencies:

`npm install`
